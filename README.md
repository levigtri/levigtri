# Hi everyone! I'm Levi Gomes.
I'm currently studying Software Engineering.
My journey with development began in 2020, when I started coming up with ideas for solutions to real-world problems. I realized that many of these solutions could be built through software development. From that moment on, I dove headfirst into this exciting journey.

- 📚 I am studying software engineering
- 🌱 I’m currently learning DevOps!

# Currently, I've worked on:

- 👨‍💻 DevOps, CI/CD, and Pipelines – I've gained hands-on experience with automating software delivery processes, implementing continuous integration and deployment workflows to improve development efficiency and reliability.

- 🔎 Researching the Use of LLMs in DevOps – I'm studying how Large Language Models (LLMs) can enhance automation in DevOps tasks, exploring ways to integrate AI-driven solutions into infrastructure management and deployment workflows.
